: When [What's Reincarnation]
 @>Text: Reincarnation is a system designed to be an alternative to 
  :    : breeding in terms of getting ideal Pokemon or Puppets.
 @>Text: The system is very simple to use. You just need one species
  :    : to reincarnate. This will reset its level, all of its EVs, its evolution,
  :    : and reroll all of its IVs.
 @>Text: There are steps you can take to have more control over the 
  :    : Reincarnation process.
 @>Text: If you have two "Donor" species, they can pass down their
  :    : IVs in a manner similar to breeding. 
 @>Text: One donor will pass down 1 stat, two will pass down 3 between
  :    : both donors.
 @>Text: You can also determine the Reincarnated species's nature
  :    : through use of two different fields where you can place items.
 @>Text: These are the "Boon" field, the stat that gets raised, and the
  :    : "Bane" field, the stat that gets lowered.
 @>Text: There is one item for every stat, including one for a 
  :    : Neutral, in case you want to randomize the Boon or Bane
  :    : while guaranteeing the other one, or just want a guaranteed
  :    : Neutral nature.
 @>Text: Finally, the last field allows you to guarantee an IV to be "Held".
 @>Text: There are six items, one for each stat. These items, when used in
  :    : the process, will ensure that the selected IV for Reincarnated species
  :    : does not get rerolled.
 @>Text: However, there is a seventh item, which allows you to guarantee
  :    : that both donor pass down 5 stat at random between them.
 @>Text: In essence, this means if you have both donors with 31 IVs in
  :    : all 6 stats, the Reincarnated species is guaranteed to have 5
  :    : stats with 31 IVs, making the process of acquiring perfect stats
  :    : on it completely trivial.
 @>Text: One last thing to mention is the Reincarnation System requires
  :    : a currency to be used, defined in items_reincarnation.txt as MAGFRAG. This
  :    : can be changed or turned off within the settings.
