--- Prefixes and Information ---

Because I like my hyper organization, I have made it so audio tracks follow a specific format
in the folder. This format is explained below.

- If a track is prefixed with "U", it is a Utility Track. These range from things such as the
  Evolution theme, or the Capture Fanfare. 
- If a track is prefixed with "B", it is a Battle track. These are tracks used when fighting
  Trainers or in Wild Encounters. 
- If a track is prefixed with "W", it is an Overworld Track. These are tracks used for the
  world at large, such as your cities and dungeons. They can also be designated this way if
  they fufill an ambient need.
- If a track is prefixed with "P" prefix, it is a Pre-Battle Into track. These tracks are used
  for Trainer Intro themes usually.


You obviously don't need to adhere to this formula, it's just how I organize things!
